## 🔐 Security Notes

* All passwords are encrypted **before** being stored in LocalStorage.
* The master password is never stored – it’s only used to derive the encryption key.
* For production, consider adding:

  * ✅ HTTPS-only deployment
  * ✅ WebAuthn / 2FA for vault unlock
  * ✅ Server sync with end-to-end encryption
  * ✅ Regular penetration testing
